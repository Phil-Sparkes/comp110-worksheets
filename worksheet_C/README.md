(a) Checks if any items on the list are repeated

(b) It's taking a value from the list O(n) and checking it against every other value of the list O(n^2) 

(c) It still checks every item on the list against every other item

(d) It’s not going over results that it has already checked

(e) Yes it’s still quadratic ((n^2)-n)/2

(f) O(n log n) http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6804124

(g) O(n) The term that is largest when n is large. O(n log n) is combined with O(n) it becomes O(n log n) + O(n)

(h) The Second - Linear is faster than quadratic given a large input.

(i) Lack of temporary storage space.
